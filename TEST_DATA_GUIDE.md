## Test User Credentials

Since these are test UUIDs, you'll need to:
1. Either modify your auth system to recognize these test UUIDs
2. Or create real auth users and update the profile IDs

### Quick Auth Testing
```sql
-- Create auth users for testing (adjust as needed for your auth system)
INSERT INTO auth.users (id, email) VALUES 
  ('11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111', 'john.doe@test.com'),
  ('22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222', 'jane.smith@test.com');
```

## Cleanup Notes

- Test data uses specific ID patterns for easy identification
- Cleanup script removes only test data, preserves real data
- Categories are preserved (they're not test data)
- Always backup before major operations

## Tips

1. **Start Small**: Test one component at a time
2. **Use Different Users**: Switch between test accounts for full experience  
3. **Check Edge Cases**: Pending bookings, no reviews yet, etc.
4. **Geographic Variety**: Test with different locations
5. **Time-based Testing**: Use various booking date ranges

Happy testing! üöÄ
