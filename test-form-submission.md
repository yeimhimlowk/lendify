# Form Submission Fix Test Plan

## Test Cases

### 1. Enter Key Prevention
- Navigate to each step (1-5) and press Enter in any input field
- **Expected**: Form should NOT submit, stay on current step
- **Console**: Should see "Preventing Enter key form submission at step: X"

### 2. Tag Input on Details Step
- Navigate to Details step (step 5)
- Type a tag and press Enter
- **Expected**: Tag should be added, form should NOT submit
- **Console**: Should see "Enter key prevented at step 5"

### 3. Next Button Navigation
- Click Next button from any step
- **Expected**: Should validate and move to next step, NO form submission
- **Console**: Should see "Next button clicked!" and step change logs

### 4. Final Step Submission
- Navigate to Review step (step 6)
- Click "Create Listing" button
- **Expected**: Form should submit and redirect to dashboard
- **Console**: Should see "Form onSubmit triggered at step 6"

### 5. Enter Key on Final Step
- Navigate to Review step (step 6)
- Press Enter (if there are any input fields)
- **Expected**: Form should be allowed to submit
- **Console**: Should see "Enter key allowed at final step 6"

## Debug Info Panel
The yellow debug info panel will show:
- All navigation events
- Enter key prevention events
- Form submission attempts
- Current step changes

## Safeguards Implemented
1. Form onSubmit handler checks currentStep === 6
2. Form onKeyDown prevents Enter except on step 6
3. Double-check in onSubmit function blocks non-final submissions
4. All buttons have proper type="button" except final submit
5. Tag input has event.stopPropagation()
