# Solution Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Rental Agreements Migration Applied
- Applied the `rental_agreements` table migration successfully
- Re-enabled rental agreement generation in BookingForm
- Re-enabled rental agreements relationship in bookings API query

### 2. ✅ Fixed Infinite API Call Loop
- Fixed React useEffect dependency issue that was causing infinite re-renders
- The bookings page no longer lags or makes repeated API calls

### 3. ✅ Fixed Booking Response Handling
- Updated BookingForm to properly handle the booking ID from API response
- Added automatic redirect to bookings page after successful booking (3 second delay)
- Fixed data field mapping issues (photos/images, address/location)

### 4. ✅ Fixed Booking Display in Dashboard
- Updated the bookings page to handle paginated API response format
- The API returns data in `data.data` format due to `createPaginatedResponse`
- Fixed field mapping to handle both `photos` and `images` arrays
- Fixed location display to handle both `address` and `location` fields

## Current Status

All issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Bookings are created successfully without errors
- ✅ Rental agreements are generated automatically
- ✅ Bookings display properly in the dashboard
- ✅ No more infinite loops or performance issues

## Next Steps

The booking system is now fully functional. Users can:
1. Create bookings without errors
2. View their bookings in the dashboard (both as renter and owner)
3. Rental agreements are automatically generated for each booking

The only remaining task is to monitor the console logs I've added to ensure authentication is working properly. Once confirmed, these debug logs can be removed.
