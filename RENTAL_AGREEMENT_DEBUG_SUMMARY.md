# Rental Agreement Generation Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Error Code in Error Enum**
- **Issue**: `ErrorCode.DATABASE_ERROR` was used but not defined in the `ErrorCode` enum
- **Fix**: Added `DATABASE_ERROR = 'DATABASE_ERROR'` to the enum in `/lib/api/errors.ts`

### 2. **Unsafe Property Access**
- **Issue**: The code was accessing nested properties without null checks (e.g., `booking.listing.price_per_day`)
- **Fix**: Added safe property access with optional chaining and fallback values throughout the agreement generation

### 3. **Database Schema Mismatch**
- **Issue**: The API was trying to insert columns that might not exist in the database (from the enhanced migration)
- **Fix**: Implemented a fallback mechanism that first tries to insert with all enhanced fields, then falls back to basic fields if columns don't exist

### 4. **Insufficient Error Logging**
- **Issue**: Errors were not being logged with enough detail to debug effectively
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error logging including error types, codes, messages, and full error objects

### 5. **Missing Data Validation**
- **Issue**: No validation for required related data (listing, renter, owner) before using them
- **Fix**: Added explicit checks for required related data with appropriate error messages

## Enhanced Error Handling

The API now includes:
1. Detailed console logging for debugging
2. Safe property access with fallbacks
3. Graceful degradation when enhanced columns don't exist
4. Better error messages for missing data
5. Development-mode debug information in API responses

## Testing the Fix

To test if the rental agreement generation is now working:

1. **Check server logs** when generating an agreement to see detailed error information
2. **Use the debug endpoint** at `/api/debug/test-agreement` to verify:
   - Authentication is working
   - Database tables exist
   - Sample bookings can be fetched
   - Table columns match expectations

3. **Common issues to check**:
   - Ensure the booking has all related data (listing, owner, renter profiles)
   - Verify the user is either the owner or renter of the booking
   - Check if database migrations have been applied

## Next Steps

If the issue persists:
1. Run the database migrations to add the enhanced columns:
   ```bash
   supabase migration up
   ```

2. Check the Supabase logs for any database-level errors

3. Verify the booking data structure matches what the API expects

4. Use the debug endpoint to get more information about the database state
